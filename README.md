# JetSetters x Solanswer

## Overview
**This project consists of three parts.**

1) A workflow to enhance LLMs with documentation and ecosystem-related data via Google Cloud's Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system. As an example, we enhance `Gemini 1.5 Pro` with the `Solana Developer Documentation`.
2) The `JetSetters Plugin` hooks into the Google Cloud backend to make use of our enhanced AI model. It is designed to provide developers with instant AI-driven documentation and code insights directly within the JetBrains IDEs. (see installation guide below)
3) The `Solanswer Website` (https://solanswer.vercel.app/) provides a web version of our AI agent. It is capable of answering in-depth questions regarding the Solana Documentation.

## Features
- **Instant Documentation Access:** Ask coding questions and receive real-time answers from the Solana Developer Docs or all other resources.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input/output fields for engaging with the AI chatbot.
- **More in-depth answers:** In domain-specific questions (example case: Solana Dev Environment) our AI Agent gives more in-depth answers than the GitHub Copilot & JetBrains AI
- **A Blueprint for other environments:** The workflow, plugin and website we built can be used plug-and-play with other vector datasets (i.e. other documentations, GitHub repos, ...)
